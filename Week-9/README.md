 #create-react-app
 
  It is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

  It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:

  npx create-react-app my-app
  cd my-app
  npm start

#npm run build

running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder. You can learn more about Create React App from its README and the User Guide.
